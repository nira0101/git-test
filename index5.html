                     In the time of the micro computer software were written specifically for each computer, as they all came with their own operating system build into them. Burned into their microchips where the commands that they understood, and programmers needed to write their programs to the specific machine. The amount of software available for a specific computer played a significant role in it’s success.

                   This is one of the reasons for the huge success of the Commodore 64. With it’s powerful graphics and sound processors it was a perfect platform for games and it gave programmers a strong platform to developed all sorts. Of the more famous ones one could mention: Archon:<ol><li>The Light and the Dark (1983) – A mythical battle chess</li> <li>Impossible Mission (1984)  - A platform action game</li><li> Pitstop II (1984) – A car race simulation</li> <li>Elite (1985) – A space simulation game</li><li> Leaderboard Golf (1986) – A sport simulation</li><li> IK+ (1987) – A fighting game</li><li> InternationalSoccer (1988) – A soccer simulation</li><li> Grand Prix Circuit (1989) – Formula One</li><li> Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday (1990) – an adventure/RPG</li><li> Creatures 2: Torture Trouble (1992) – Platform type and Mayhem in Monsterland (1993) – A platform type</li>
