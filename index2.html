                        <h1>MY EXPERIENCE</h1>

                    <p>I was about 8 years old when i got it and
                        i was really happy.It was a present from my father and i was wasnt expecting it.I wanted a laptop/desktop cause everyone in my class had it,and my friends used to play alot of games on it.So i asked my father to buy me one,at first he he wasnt willing,i asked him many times but he still wasnt agreeing to by one.After some time i stoped asking him thinking he really wont buy a laptop for me.Supprisingly,at the end of grade 8(i guess),when i returned to home from school,i saw something in my bed and was really currious because it was wrpped in a gift paper.At first i thought it was prank from my sister,but when i opened,it was a laptop.It was one of the happiest  day in my life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I mostly used the laptop to play games like:mario,CS,GTA Vice city,GTA Sanaandreas and etc.I didnt knew much about the computer at that time and it was used for,i mostly used it for playing games ,saving photos,listining to music and videos.i had no idea about the softwares,OS,processor etc.I only knew how to install a software.
