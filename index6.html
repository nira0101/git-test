The IBM PC used a software operating system. This had to load on startup, but made it easier to update - simply because you did not need to buy a completely new piece of hardware. The OS (for Operating System) was called MSDOS, this was short for Micro-Soft Disk Operating System (yes, they used a dash in their name in the early days).

From calculators to communication devices

                     Computers continued to develop.<p>In the micro computer age the computer were mostly used as a very specialized machine. In many cases it was a toy used for gaming or a little bit of home programming. Later that changed, as the internet developed and people began to connect. In the words of Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and the developer of MSDOS: “I think it's fair to say that personal computers have become the most empowering tool we've ever created. They're tools of communication, they're tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by their user.”
